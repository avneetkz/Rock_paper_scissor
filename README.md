# Rock_paper_scissor
It's a two player game where player 1 will be the user and player 2 will be the computer .

## Code Approach
Player 1 will get to choose manually between rock, paper and scissor while player 2 which is a computer will randomly select its choice using the 'random module'. We have import random module for this. Then there are certain if, elif and else conditional statements which will get us the result of the game.
